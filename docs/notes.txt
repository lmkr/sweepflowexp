Need to use dos2unix in order to be able to parse properly.

In bt.dve there was an occurcen of X, c==1 that was changed to X && c==1

Inconsistencise that need to be fixed between generated code and signatures:

- MODEL signature
- SERIALISER signature
- HASH_FUNCTION signature
- INDEPENDEN_RELATION (does the signature exists?)
