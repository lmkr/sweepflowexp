We could do the analysis both in a monotonic and a non-monotonic variant as per the loop. This can be done by not increasing progress inside the loop.

-

We could also look at a reduced model where structural reduction is
applied to the model prior to conducting the analysis.

- 

For this particular example it could be of benefit to move the
sweep-line back immediatly as a regress edge has been seen in order to
avoid unnecssary exploration of a large part of the state space.

-

there is some potential problem with the statistics collected by the
sweep-line exploration. Bot everything is initialised. Perhaps try to
use the debug variant of the exploration.
