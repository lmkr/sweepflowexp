We could do the analysis both in a monotonic and a non-monotonic
variant as per the loop. This can be done by not increasing progress
inside the loop.

-

We could also look at a reduced model where structural reduction is
applied to the model prior to conducting the analysis.

For this particular example it could be of benefit to move the
sweep-line back immediatly as a regress edge has been seen in order to
avoid unnecssary exploration of a large part of the state space.

there is some potential problem with the statistics collected by the
sweep-line exploration. Bot everything is initialised. Perhaps try to
use the debug variant of the exploration.

- 

the use of a persistence predicate could also be of benefit here to
mark the entry of loops and make them persistent straightaway.

Working on the DVE version:

_ in front of identifiers had to be removed.

In this version processes does not have internal states as earlier. 

Statistics: Exploration of DVE model sweep=1,arcs=35,states=33, peak=5 (reduction to 15%)
            Exploration of CPN model sweep=1 arcs=38,states=37, peak=3 (reduction to  8%)

There is a slight difference in size of state space and also peak. This just needs to be checked.

Maybe it can be proved from the way that we define the progress
measure based on the structure of the workflow that we can never
encounter a regress edge that we have not seen in the forward flow. In
this way we can totally ignore states at the end of regress edges. If
this is not the case, then we can provide an example saying why this
is not so - which would also be a contribution.
